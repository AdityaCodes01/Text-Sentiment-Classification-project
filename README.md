The Stock Market Price Prediction using LSTM project is a Python-based time-series forecasting application that predicts future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequential data. 
The code leverages the yfinance library to fetch historical stock data, preprocesses it with scaling and sequence creation, trains an LSTM model using Keras, and visualizes the results with Matplotlib. 
The goal is to predict future stock prices based on past trends, demonstrating a practical application of deep learning in financial analysis.


Workflow Summary:
Data Acquisition: Fetches historical closing prices for a specified stock (e.g., AAPL) using yfinance.
Preprocessing: Scales prices to [0, 1] and creates 60-day sequences for training and testing.
Model Training: Trains a two-layer LSTM model to learn patterns in the sequences.
Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict future prices on the test set.
Visualization: Plots the results to visually compare actual and predicted prices.


Why This Approach?
LSTM Suitability: LSTMs are designed for sequential data, capturing long-term dependencies in stock price trends, which are often non-linear and influenced by historical patterns.
Data Scaling: Normalizing data ensures stable training, as stock prices can vary widely (e.g., $100â€“$200 for AAPL).
Sequence Length (60 days): Chosen to balance capturing sufficient historical context with computational efficiency.
Visualization: Helps users assess model performance intuitively, highlighting how closely predictions match actual prices.

Limitations and Considerations:
Data Dependency: The model relies on historical closing prices, ignoring other factors like volume, news, or macroeconomic indicators, which could improve accuracy.
Overfitting Risk: Training for 50 epochs may lead to overfitting; users could add dropout layers or early stopping.
Stationarity: Stock prices are non-stationary, so the model may struggle with sudden market shifts.
Hyperparameters: The choice of 60 timesteps, 50 LSTM units, and 32 batch size is reasonable but could be tuned for better performance.
